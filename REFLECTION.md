# üß† Reflection: Open-Source Collaboration Experience

Participating in the open-source simulation for Assignment 14 was a valuable learning experience. It allowed me to step outside of traditional solo project work and explore what it means to maintain a public-facing, collaborative software project.

## üîß Improvements Based on Peer Feedback

After sharing my GitHub repository with classmates, I received stars, forks, and even a couple of pull requests. Their feedback helped me identify and improve small areas I had overlooked, such as typos in the README and adding clearer setup steps for contributors.

One suggestion was to improve the formatting in the console demo, which led me to refactor the output in `HospitalRunner`. Another student pointed out the need for null-checking in my factory classes, which I addressed through additional unit tests and validations.

I also noticed that people appreciated the well-structured CI/CD pipeline. This encouraged me to document it more clearly in the README, showing others how it works and how to use it locally.

## ü§ù Challenges in Onboarding Contributors

One of the biggest challenges was learning how to make the project "welcoming" to first-time contributors. Initially, I didn‚Äôt have a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file or clearly labeled issues. After reading GitHub‚Äôs open-source guidelines and reviewing peers' repositories, I created clear onboarding instructions and labeled beginner-friendly tasks as `good-first-issue`.

Another difficulty was choosing a license and understanding what it means. I ended up selecting the MIT license because it‚Äôs open and permissive, which made it easier for classmates to contribute freely.

## üåç Lessons Learned

This assignment taught me the importance of:
- Clear documentation
- Writing maintainable code
- Structuring issues for collaboration
- The value of automated workflows (CI/CD)
- Building community around a project

I also realized how important it is to communicate your work well ‚Äî not just through code, but through READMEs, labels, and organized folders.

## ‚úÖ Final Thoughts

Collaborating on GitHub with peers and managing contributions was both rewarding and challenging. I feel more confident contributing to real open-source projects in the future and understand what it takes to maintain one. Most importantly, I learned that **collaboration isn‚Äôt just about code ‚Äî it‚Äôs about clarity, support, and communication.**
