### 📘 Overview

This is a modular **Hospital Management System** built in C#. It applies **all six creational design patterns** in real-world healthcare scenarios (e.g., patient registration, staff assignment, report generation). The system is designed for learning purposes and demonstrates scalable architecture and object-oriented principles.

### 🧩 Design Patterns Implemented

| Pattern          | Purpose                                           | Class Example |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| **Simple Factory** | Centralized patient creation                    | `PatientFactory` |
| **Factory Method** | Flexible notification systems                   | `EmailFactory`, `SmsFactory` |
| **Abstract Factory** | Consistent creation of related objects       | `PediatricStaffFactory` |
| **Builder**         | Step-by-step creation of complex reports       | `DiagnosisReportBuilder` |
| **Prototype**       | Cloning prescriptions to avoid reconfiguration | `AntibioticPrescription` |
| **Singleton**       | Shared DB connection for all services          | `DatabaseConnection` |
