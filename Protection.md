# Branch Protection Justification

Enforcing protection rules on the `main` branch ensures that:
- All changes are peer-reviewed, which helps maintain code quality.
- Only verified, tested code gets merged, preventing bugs in production.
- Developers follow a collaborative workflow using pull requests.
- The integrity and stability of the production branch are maintained.
