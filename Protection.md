# Branch Protection Rules: Justification

To ensure high-quality code and collaboration standards, we applied the following protection rules to the `main` branch:

## ✅ Require Pull Request Reviews
- Prevents direct code merges.
- Promotes collaboration through peer review.
- Helps catch bugs and logic errors early.

## ✅ Require Status Checks to Pass
- Ensures all tests pass before code is merged.
- Prevents broken code from reaching the production branch.

## ✅ Block Direct Pushes
- All code must go through a PR.
- Adds a layer of accountability and review.
- Helps maintain a clean commit history.

These rules align with industry best practices and ensure a more stable and secure development workflow.
